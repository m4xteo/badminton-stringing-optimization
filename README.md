# Badminton Stringing Optimzation
Converter for finding the equilibrium tension for badminton strings and many more!

# Introduction / Problem

Badminton strings have different string diameters ranging from 0.58mm to 0.70mm. However, there is a dilemna of finding the perfect string tension in comparison to another badminton string with higher or lower diameter. For example, BG80 (0.68 mm) pulled at 28lbs tension is not equal to Aerosonic (0.61mm) pulled at 28lbs tension. So how do we find the equilibrium tension here? What tension do we need to pull the BG80 string to match Aerosonic at 28lbs? 


We could look at the frequency of each string and correlate itself with string diameter (which probably works). However, strings are made with different core materials and could affect the natural frequency due to the dampening effects of the individual materials used (and the density of each string) such as Multifilament cores vs Monofilament cores
